  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>My name is Patrick White. I'm a technologist, which means I use technology (mostly software, in my case) to solve problems and create value. </p>
  <p>I also have strong opinions about what openness and transparency should mean in the age of the Internet, particularly with regards to government records and other public domain materials. The current vehicle for my activism is <a href="http://www.verypublicrecords.com">Very Public Records</a>.</p>
