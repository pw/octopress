Very Public Records exists to improve access to public records and operates in accordance with the Very Public Principles:

* A record is public only if it can be easily found and accessed online.
* When the marginal cost of distribution is nearly zero, charging for access to public records constitutes a bribe.
* There are many like it, but this one record is important.
* Take-downs only to protect the innocent.
------------------
What does that mean in practice? So far, not much, but the idea is I pay for access to public records (1) and put them online. I pay the bribe so others don't have to. 

Beyond that, I have a number of ideas for ways to make the sure the records can be "easily found and accessed online." Some of these ideas are more nefarious than others ;-)

Footnotes:

1. Including things like the [NOAA Diving Manual](http://www.verypublicrecords.com/the-noaa-diving-manual-free-and-in-the-public/), which the government wrote, but still charges to access.
