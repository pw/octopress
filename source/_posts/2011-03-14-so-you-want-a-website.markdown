If want a website and don't already have one, the **absolute worst** thing you can do is hire someone to build you a website.

Instead, figure out how who in your organization should be updating your website (if you had one), and do whatever it takes to get that person to start posting online. And 'whatever it takes' usually means 'make it really, really easy.'

You do this by meeting people where they are. Can they use email? Use [Posterous](http://posterous.com/). Are they always on [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/pages/create.php)? Have them create a Facebook Page. Leverage the skills they already have. 

Also, notice that I said 'should' and not 'can' or 'is willing to' update your website The person who should update your website is the person that has information to impart to your audience. Having anyone else do it will create barriers, information will not get published and your website will never take off. 

Once you're reliably, consistently publishing online then, and only then, should you consult a professional.

(If you need a website and don't already have one, you'll have read to my upcoming post "Why You Don't Need a Website".)
