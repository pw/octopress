Over the last nine months or so, I've been trying to learn search engine optimization (SEO). I've had a few success, but so far the tactics have been fairly domain-specific. Below is my advice to a hypothetical local photography studio that is looking to improve their rankings. I'm assuming that they've already done basic [on-page optimization](http://www.seomoz.org/blog/perfecting-keyword-targeting-on-page-optimization) (good title-tags, etc) and now need to move on to getting links: 

What you need at this point are links. But you probably already knew that ;-)

There are a couple of ways you can get links. Some of them scale and some don't. 
The ways that don't scale involve leveraging a real-world relationships or creating new real-world relationships. For example, I see that you're part of the several music groups and have bios on both of those sites. Those bios should link back to your photography studio website. Of course, trying to get "In his spare time, John Doe also runs his own <link>photography studio</link>." added to your musician bio would be a bit tactless and probably wouldn't work. Instead, you a could interview yourself about your musical career and host it on your photography studio's website. Just generic interview questions like, "How did your career in music start?", and "What has been your most memorable performance?" Then ask to have a link to the interview added to your musician bio.

You can also get links by creating new relationships. I've sure there are groups with a strong web presence that would happy to link to you in exchange for a free photo shoot. I'm thinking independent bands, some nonprofits, the sort of groups that might be reputation rich, but cash poor. But again, this doesn't scale. The benefit required will always be proportional to the effort you put in, so it's not a good long-term strategy, but these things might be worth doing to get an initial boost. 

As for methods that do scale, your best bet is creating content that lots people will want to link to. Fortunately, you already do some of this when taking photographs. Your site mentions that photos are delivered to clients via an online gallery. Is that gallery on your site? Does it have a optional public page that people can share with their friends? Does that public page have a nice "Share my new wedding/graduation/etc photos on Facebook/Twitter/etc" button? It should, because that's the link goldmine built into your existing business.
