I was reading [this post](http://www.jamesmaybe.com/blog/2010/12/scrambled-brains-i-got-a-toasted-mind/) on [JamesMaybe.com](http://jamesmaybe.com/), a pseudonymous (it seems) art blog, and came across this: 

> "One is my day (and night) job. I look for arbitrage opportunities in semi-liquid, online-tradeable markets." 

Then on his about page:

> "He [James Maybe] currently works as an arbitrageur in complex, incomplete markets, and blogs part-time about art and related matters."

The [original post](http://www.jamesmaybe.com/blog/2010/12/scrambled-brains-i-got-a-toasted-mind/) was alright, but arbitrage in complex, semi-liquid, incomplete, online-tradeable markets? That's really interesting. 

From what I could figure out, "James" is a certain Canadian statistician, and the market he's referring to is domain names. There are a number of clues, but this cryptic blog post is the most interesting: [230.com Is About To Make James Maybe a Gizillionaire](http://fragerfactor.blogspot.com/2009/08/230com-is-about-to-make-james-maybe.html)

But the question remains: how, exactly, do you arbitrage domains? There's mention of ["numbers and algorithms"](http://www.jamesmaybe.com/blog/2010/04/ship-me-back-home-from-a-secret-location/), so he must be doing something more sophisticated than the usual domain speculating.
