There's a [lot hiding](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Lsp8oZjKk3cJ:www.quickr.org/+.http://quickr.org/&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&source=www.google.com) behind that [simple search box](http://quickr.org/). Quickr.org is probably getting at least half a million visitors a month. Since it's all search traffic, that means at least $5k a month in earnings from Adsense. And it seems completely unaffected by Google's Panda update. [Nice work, if you can get it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A58ecFDFPvQ)

I might have to do a "anatomy of a MFA site" post.
