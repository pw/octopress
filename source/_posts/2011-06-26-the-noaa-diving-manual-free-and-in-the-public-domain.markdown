The NOAA Diving Manual is diving manual created by NOAA and touted as ["The Definitive Encyclopedia Of Diving" and "A Must-Have For Serious Divers."](http://www.dive.noaa.gov/) But instead of being available for free, the manual must be [purchased from NTIS](http://www.ntis.gov/products/noaadive.aspx) for the princely sum of $89 (or $136 if you're ordering from outside North America).  

The copyright status of the NOAA Diving Manual is curious. In general, a work of the federal government, defined as ["a work prepared by an officer or employee of the U.S. government as part of that person's official duties"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_status_of_work_by_the_U.S._government) is not subject to copyright. The manual certainly looks as if it's a work of the federal government. 

However, the manual is published in cooperation with Best Publishing Company, who, in response to my email asking about the manual's copyright, claimed that "The entire 'NOAA Diving Manual, 4th Ed.' is copyrighted by Best Publishing Company." They claimed this despite the fact the this paragraph appears in the manual:

> Portions of this publication contain work prepared by officers and employees of the United States Government as part of such personâ€™s official duties. No copyright is claimed as to any chapter or section whose author is an employee of the United States Government, except copyright is claimed for all other material in this publication. Inquiries concerning reproduction or copying any material herein should be sent to the publisher for permission.

When the above paragraph was brought to the attention of Best Publishing, they "spoke with NOAA regarding this, and they [NOAA] confirmed that the 4th edition was a general collaboration between NOAA employees and miscellaneous diving experts." But they maintained their claim to the manual's copyright, because, "BPC [Best Publishing Company] is the publishing company, and whoever publishes a book is generally the owner of the copyright- not the authors." 

As far as I know, that last statement is patently false. A work's copyright belongs to the work's author, unless the author assigns it to someone else. Or, as I believe to be the case here, the author is an employee of the federal government, and the work becomes a work of the United States government, and thus enters the public domain.

As such, I'm making the NOAA Diving Manual: Diving for Science and Technology, 4th Edition available here for free.
