this is my ﬁrst rule for radicals: call everything you do 
an experiment

This is thus my second rule for radicals, and that is 
when the authorities ﬁnally ﬁre that starting gun—and do 
something like send you tapes—run as fast as you can, so 
when they get that queasy feeling in their stomach and 
have second thoughts, it is too late to stop.


And this brings us to rule number 3, which is that 
eyeballs rule. Build up a user base, and you have much 
more leverage than if you’re just blowing smoke


Rule 4 is that when you achieve your objective, don’t be 
afraid to turn on a dime and be nice. You can bang the 
table and be a total pain in the ass, but there comes a time 
to be helpful, courteous, and friendly

Rule 5 is pretty simple. Keep asking—keep rephrasing 
the question until they can say yes.

 So here is rule 6 for radicals, which is 
when you get the microphone, make sure you make your 
point clearly and succinctly

Here is my seventh rule for radicals, which is to get 
standing. One can criticize government all one wants, and 
they’ll often ignore you. But, if there is something clearly 
wrong and against the law and you can document that 
malfeasance and wrongdoing, they have to talk to you. If 
you have standing, you can insist.

There is a related rule, and that is rule 8, which is to try to 
get the bureaucrats to threaten you. Remember how the 
law has a special place when it comes to copyright? While 
a state government might be able to assert copyright over 
some things, the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that 
nobody can copyright the law. This means no copyright on 
court opinions, but it also means no copyright on state 
statutes...

Once you have a takedown notice, particularly from a 
body as eminent as the lawyer for the Oregon legislature, 
you are in legal peril. You have a right to think they’re 
going to sue you, because that’s what the takedown notice 
says.
If you’re in legal peril, you can go to a judge and ask for 
what’s called declaratory relief, asking the court to rule on 
the issue. So, we hired a lawyer and put together a draft 
declaratory relief request and posted it on the net.
The thing about a state sending you a takedown notice 
for putting the law on the Internet is that this is not one of 
the subtle legal issues that you have to carefully explain to 
people. Everybody gets this—you can walk into any bar 
and explain what’s going on and everybody will instantly 
get the issue and say “that’s really stupid.


And that’s my rule 9 for radicals—look for overreaching, something that is clearly nuts. Not being able to 
publish state statutes certainly qualiﬁed on that count


Rule 1: Call everything an experiment.
Rule 2: When the starting gun goes off, run really fast. 
As a small player, the elephant can step on you, but you 
can outrun the elephant.
Rule 3: Eyeballs rule. If a million people use your 
service, and on the Internet you can do that, you’ve got a 
lot more credibility than if you’re just issuing position 
papers and ﬂaming the man.
Rule 4: When the time comes, be nice.
Rule 5: Keep asking until they say yes. Gordon Bell, the 
inventor of the VAX, once said that you should keep your 
vision, but modify your plan.
Rule 6: When you get the microphone, get to the point. 
Be clear about what you want.
Rule 7: Get standing. Have some skin in the game, some 
reason you’re at the table.
Rule 8: Get them to threaten you.
Rule 9: Look for overreaching, things that are just 
blatantly, obviously wrong or silly.
And ﬁnally, rule 10, which is don’t be afraid to fail. It 
took Thomas Edison 10,000 times before he got the lightbulb right, and when he was asked about those 
failures, he said “I have not failed, I’ve just found 10,000 
ways that won’t work.”
Fail. Fail often. And don’t forget, you can question 
authority.
Thank you very much.
