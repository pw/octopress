For all the things I hate about [The Sheridan Press](http://www.thesheridanpress.com), I have to admit that newspapers have their hearts in the right place. The Wyoming Press Association just launched [WyoPublicNotices.com](http://www.wyopublicnotices.com), "a searchable database of public notices from around the state." It's a great idea, and the Wyoming Press Association should be appauled for acting on it, but their execution of the idea is abysmal. 

When you search for public notices from, say, The Sheridan Press, the most recent entry is [this](http://www.verypublicrecords.com/images/wyopublic_sheridan_press.png), which is from July 9 and appears to be a scan of an actual newpaper page. Admittedly, the notices from some of the papers are digital and a bit more current, but even notices from Casper Star-Tribue are several weeks old and look like [this](http://www.verypublicrecords.com/images/wyopublic_casper_star.png). 

And, of course, the website itself is utter shit. It's a usability nightmare: The title and logo in the upper-left don't link to the home page, so you never know how to start over. The url and page title don't change as you move between pages, so you're never really sure where you are. The search interface, which is the entire reason the site exists, is stuck in the left third of the screen and, like the rest of the site, uses really tiny print. Then there are those "Previous Page" and "Next Page" buttons in the upper-right. They're present throughout the site, but do nothing when you click them. 

The worst part, though, is this scary statement that shows up across the site:

> "All content on this web site is copyrighted material, and may not be reproduced in any form without the express consent of the Wyoming Press Association and its constituent member newspapers." 

The public notices posted on the site show up in newspaper pages alongside other content. That other content could be anything and some, if not all of it, is copyrighted material. But the public notices themselves are, by their very nature, not copyrighted material. So it's certainly not true that "All content on this web site is copyrighted material." Members of the Wyoming Press Association aren't idiots, and they're all for access to public documents, so the only reason I can think of the including that statement is paranoia.

It's the paranoia of those publishers who, when they think about the internet, consider first and foremost the possibility of their content being stolen.
